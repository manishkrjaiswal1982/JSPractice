To mitigate render-blocking issues and improve page load performance, you can 
employ the following techniques below:

1. Asynchronous Loading: Use the async or defer attribute with the script tag to load 
    JavaScript files asynchronously.     
    
    <script src="script.js" async></script>  or <script src="script.js" defer></script>       

2. Move Scripts to the Bottom: Place script tags just before the closing body tag.
3. Lazy Loading: Lazy-loading defers the loading and execution of JavaScript until it's 
    required, improving the initial page load time.
    
    <script src="script.js" defer="true" type="module"></script>
